The Light Plate Apparatus (LPA)
===============================
test test test
The LPA is a general purpose, customizable, user-friendly, open-source instrument for performing optogenetics and other photobiology experiments in batch and adherent cell culture systems. Using the LPA, each well of a 24-well plate can be independently exposed to variable intensity, millisecond time-scale signals from one or two LEDs.

If you use the LPA in your research, please cite the following publication:

- Gerhardt K. et al. **The Light Plate Apparatus (LPA): a flexible, low cost, user-friendly hardware platform for optogenetics and photobiology**. *ACS Synth. Biol*, 2016.
