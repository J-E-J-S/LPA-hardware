How to use
==========
Electronic CAD files were created on KiCAD, which can be downloaded from http://kicad-pcb.org/
To see the CAD files, open KiCAD, go to File -> Open Project, and select "tca.pro". KiCAD will show a list of files on its left panel. The most important are tca.sch (schematic diagram) and tca.kicad_pcb (printed circuit board (PCB) diagram). Double click on each to open.
