# TCA: Two-Color Array
## An optogenetic device for a 24-well plate

The TCA is a device for 24-well plates capable of illuminating each well with two independently time-varying light signals. An electronic board based on the Atmega328 microcontroller reads light intensity values from an SD card and controls the LEDs responsible for illumination.
