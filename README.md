# LPA - The Light Plate Apparatus
## An optogenetic device for n-well plates.

The TCA is a device for n-well plates capable of illuminating each well with two independently time-varying light signals. An electronic board based on the Atmega328 microcontroller reads light intensity values from an SD card and controls the LEDs responsible for illumination.
