# LPA - The Light Plate Apparatus
## A device for optogenetic experiments in 24-well plates.

The LPA is a device capable of illuminating each well of a 24-well plate with two independently time-varying light signals. An electronic board based on the Atmega328 microcontroller reads light intensity values from an SD card and controls the LEDs responsible for illumination.

### Contents:
